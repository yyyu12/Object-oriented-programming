# Assignment 1 -- Task 6
Implement the set type which contains integers. Represent the set as a sequence of its elements. Implement as methods: inserting an element, removing an element, returning whether the set is empty, returning whether the set contains an element, returning a random element without removing it from the set, returning the number of even numbers in the set (suggestion: store the number of even numbers and update it when the set changes), printing the set. A set can store every element only once.
